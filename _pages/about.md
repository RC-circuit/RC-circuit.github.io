Hi folks! I am Ruthwik, a final year undergraduate from the department of mechanical engineering at IIT Madras. I take interest in the fields of numerical techniques, numerical analysis, scientific machine learning, deep learning, high performance computing and partial differential equations. I was fortunate to do courses in these domains offered by some of the best professors at IIT Madras. 

I interned at American Express during the summer '24. I served as the AI Club head, Center for Innovation, IIT Madras, Apr '23 - Mar '24 where I got to work with some amazing people who shared a common passion for AI. I am currently working under Prof. Konduri Aditya, IISc Bangalore, Computational and Data Sciences department. I recently picked up the habit of reading autobiographies. I enjoy playing chess in my free time and love watching cricket.
