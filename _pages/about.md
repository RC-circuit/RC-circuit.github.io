Hi folks! I am Ruthwik, a final year undergraduate student pursuing Btech + Honors from the department of Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Artificial Intelligence at IIT Madras. I am exploring the possibilities of bridging the gaps in traditional numerical solvers using surrogate deep learning methods to build hybrid frameworks that use the best of both worlds. My research interests are numerical techniques, PDE solvers, scientific machine learning, deep learning and high performance computing. I have done several courses in these domains offered by the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIT Madras.(for more details check the coursework section)

I interned at American Express as a Data Analyst during the summer '24, being my first corporate experience where I worked on computational finance and energy efficient fuzzy matching algorithms. I served as the [AI Club](https://www.aiclubcfi.com/) Head, [Center for Innovation](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, Apr '23 - Mar '24 where I got to lead and work with an amazing team of over 50 members who shared the same energy and passion for AI and its applications in engineering. As part of the tenure, We worked with [Prof. Nagabhushana Rao Vadlamani](https://home.iitm.ac.in/nrv/) on an interdisciplinary project integrating AI and aerospace engineering: Inverse design of airfoils using data driven approaches. I have been working under [Prof. Konduri Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), IISc Bangalore, Computational and Data Sciences department from  winter '23, which enhanced my research experience and capabilities. We are looking into the possibilities of integrating neural architecture models with lower order solvers to enhance their accuracy and stability leading to longer time rollouts. I am working with [Prof. Kameswararao Anupindi](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kanupindi/) for my BTech Project where we are studying the modeling of dust accumulation on wind turbine blades and assess its effect on performance.



I love reading and watching podcasts of deep-tech startup founders and try to take inspiration from their entrepreneurial risk taking abilities and perseverance to stay patient, disciplined and driven throughout the journey. Though a novice at most sports, I enjoy casually playing chess, cricket, badminton in my free time. I'm a passionate foodie with a love for all cuisines, always eager to explore new flavors. And when it comes to pizza, I never shy away from having another sliceâ€”just as long as it's vegetarian!
