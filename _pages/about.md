Hi folks! I am Ruthwik, a final year undergraduate student pursuing Btech + Honors from the department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I am exploring the possibilities of bridging the gaps in traditional numerical solvers using surrogate deep learning methods to build hybrid PDE frameworks that use the best of both worlds. My research interests are numerical techniques, PDE solvers, scientific machine learning, physics informed machine learning and high performance computing. I was fortunate to do several courses in these domains offered by the institute from departments of Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.(for more details check the coursework section)

I interned at American Express as a Data Analyst during the summer '24, being my first corporate experience where I worked on computational finance and energy efficient fuzzy matching algorithms. I served as the [AI Club](https://www.aiclubcfi.com/) Head, [Center for Innovation](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, Apr '23 - Mar '24 where I got to lead and work with an amazing team of over 50 members who shared the same passion for AI and its applications in engineering. As part of the tenure, We worked with [Prof. Nagabhushana Rao Vadlamani](https://home.iitm.ac.in/nrv/) on an interdisciplinary project integrating AI and aerospace engineering: Inverse design of airfoils using data driven approaches. I have been working under [Prof. Konduri Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), IISc Bangalore, Computational and Data Sciences department from  winter '23, which enhanced my research experience and capabilities. We are looking into the possibilities of integrating neural architecture models with lower order solvers to enhance their accuracy and stability leading to longer time rollouts. I am working with [Prof. Kameswararao Anupindi](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kanupindi/) for my BTech Project where we are studying the modeling of dust accumulation on wind turbine blades and assess its effect on performance.



I love reading and watching podcasts of deep-tech startup founders, taking inspiration from their entrepreneurial risk taking abilities, always admired by their perseverance to stay disciplined and driven through all the twists and turns entailing the journey. Though a novice at most sports, I enjoy casually playing chess, cricket, badminton in my free time. I'm a passionate foodie with a love for all cuisines, always eager to explore new flavors.
